## Why?

Because I believe that coding Agentic AI should be as easy as possible. I am coming from the
[creative coding community](https://creativecode.berlin/), where
we are teaching artists, without prior programming experience, how to express their creations through
code as a medium. I want to give creators of all kinds this extremely powerful tool, so that
**you can turn your own machine into an outside window, through which, the AI system can perceive
your world and your needs, and act upon this information.**

There is no official Anthropic SDK for Kotlin, a de facto standard for Android development. The one for Java
is also lacking. Even if they will appear one day, we can expect them to be autogenerated by the
[Stainless API bot](https://www.stainlessapi.com/), which is used by both, Anthropic and OpenAI, to automate
their SDK development based on evolving API. While such an approach seem to work with dynamically typed languages,
it might fail short with statically typed languages like Kotlin, sacrificing typical language idioms in favor
of [over-verbose constructs](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-go/blob/main/examples/tools/main.go).
This library is a [Kotlin multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html)
therefore your AI agents developed with it can be seamlessly used in Android, JVM, JavaScript, iOS, WebAssembly,
and many other environments.

## Usage

_:warning: This SDK is in the early stage of development, but at the same time it is completely functional and passing
[test cases](src/commonTest/kotlin)._

Add to your `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
dependencies {
  implementation("com.xemantic.anthropic:anthropic-sdk-kotlin:.0.2.2")
  implementation("io.ktor:ktor-client-java:3.0.0") // or the latest ktor version
} 
```

The simplest code look like:

```kotlin
fun main() {
  val anthropic = Anthropic()
  val response = runBlocking {
    anthropic.messages.create {
      +Message {
        +"Hello, Claude"
      }
    }
  }
  println(response)
}
```

### Response streaming

Streaming is also possible:

```kotlin
fun main() {
  val client = Anthropic()
  runBlocking {
    client.messages.stream {
      +Message { +"Write me a poem." }
    }
      .filterIsInstance<ContentBlockDeltaEvent>()
      .map { (it.delta as Delta.TextDelta).text }
      .collect { delta -> println(delta) }
  }
}
```

### Using tools

If you want to write AI agents, you need tools, and this is where this library shines:

```kotlin
@AnthropicTool(
  name = "get_weather",
  description = "Get the weather for a specific location"
)
data class WeatherTool(val location: String): UsableTool {
  override fun use(
    toolUseId: String
  ) = ToolResult(
    toolUseId,
    "The weather is 73f" // it should use some external service
  )
}

fun main() = runBlocking {

  val client = Anthropic {
    tool<WeatherTool>()
  }

  val conversation = mutableListOf<Message>()
  conversation += Message { +"What is the weather in SF?" }

  val initialResponse = client.messages.create {
    messages = conversation
    useTools()
  }
  println("Initial response:")
  println(initialResponse)

  conversation += initialResponse.asMessage()
  val tool = initialResponse.content.filterIsInstance<ToolUse>().first()
  val toolResult = tool.use()
  conversation += Message { +toolResult }

  val finalResponse = client.messages.create {
    messages = conversation
    useTools()
  }
  println("Final response:")
  println(finalResponse)
}
```

The advantage comes no only from reduced verbosity, but also the class annotated with
the `@AnthropicTool` will have its JSON schema automatically sent to the Anthropic API when
defining the tool to use. For the reference check equivalent examples in the official
Anthropic SDKs:

* [TypeScript](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-typescript/blob/main/examples/tools.ts)
* [Python](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python/blob/main/examples/tools.py)
* [Go](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-go/blob/main/examples/tools/main.go)

None of them is taking the advantage of automatic schema generation, which becomes crucial
for maintaining agents expecting more complex and structured input from the LLM.

### Injecting dependencies to tools

Tools can be provided with dependencies, for example singleton
services providing some facilities, like HTTP client to connect to the
internet or DB connection pool to access the database. 

```kotlin
@AnthropicTool(
  name = "query_database",
  description = "Executes SQL on the database"
)
data class DatabaseQueryTool(val sql: String): UsableTool {

  internal lateinit var connection: Connection

  override fun use(
    toolUseId: String
  ) = ToolResult(
    toolUseId,
    text = connection.prepareStatement(sql).use { statement ->
      statement.resultSet.use { resultSet ->
        resultSet.toString()
      }
    }
  )

}

fun main() = runBlocking {

  val client = Anthropic {
    tool<DatabaseQueryTool> {
      connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:...")
    }
  }

  val response = client.messages.create {
    +Message { +"Select all the users who never logged in to the the system" }
    useTools()
  }

  val tool = response.content.filterIsInstance<ToolUse>().first()
  val toolResult = tool.use()
  println(toolResult)
}
```

After the `DatabaseQueryTool` is decoded from the API response, it can be processed
by the lambda function passed to the tool definition. In case of the example above,
the lambda will inject a JDBC connection to the tool.

More sophisticated code examples targeting various Kotlin platforms can be found in the
[anthropic-sdk-kotlin-demo](https://github.com/xemantic/anthropic-sdk-kotlin-demo)
project.

## Building the project

```shell
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-goes-here
./gradlew build
```

Many [unit tests](src/commonTest/kotlin) are actually integration tests calling Anthropic APIs
and asserting against results. This is the reason why they might be flaky from time to time. For
example if the test image is misinterpreted, or Claude is randomly fantasizing too much.
